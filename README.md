## Project info
 The Project objective is broadly described as identification of genuine and fraud credit card transactions using some advanced Machine Learning
 classification methodologies.

## Technologies
* Python 3.x
* Machine Learning: Linear regression classifier, SVM classifier, XGBOOST, SMOTE

## Dataset
* The Dataset provided in ULB Machine Learning group http://www.ulb.ac.be/di/map/adalpozz/ 

## Setup

The project can be run in stand-alone machine with original datasets.
```
-> copy Code and Dataset folders onto PC or Cloud Compute machines
-> Open ipython (Jupyter) notebook.
-> Upload .ipynb files
-> Changes the file path as per the OS and run all cells.

```
